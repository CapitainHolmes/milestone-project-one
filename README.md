# BAND FAN PAGE - NIRVANA
 
#### User-Centric Front-End Development Project

In this project, we were asked to create a 4-5 page website for a band. The band was to be from the 1960s and have around 50 years experience, but I stepped away from that a little basing my project on the band called Nirvana, from the late 1980s to mid 1990s. 
Although being a more modern band, I changed some key parts of infomation to fit in with the "1960s" and "50 years exeperience" theme. For example, changing the date of birth for the band members and not acknowledging the fact that one of the members has died, "Kurt Cobain".

## UX DESIGN

For this project I have used the Framework known as "[Bootstrap 3.3.7](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/)" for the layout and added my own CSS for the look of the website.

This website is aimed at not just loyal fans but new ones, looking for infomation and a chance to book their favourite band for venues, such as "Birthdays".
It is easily navigated with an easily understandable navigation bar. All infomation is displayed clear and easy to see. All media such as "<img>" and "<iframe>" has been sized accordingly.


## FEATURES

All pages on this site include the "Header" and "Footer". The Header consists of the navigation bar and logo. The Footer has links to Official Nirvana social media pages and "Terms/Privacy" pages.

I chose "Gold" and "Black" for the main colors as they are used for Nirvana's actual logo. The colors used in this project were:

- "#fab824" (**Gold. Text Color**)
- "#a3730c" (**strong orange(brown)/strong gamboge. Hover Effect**)
- "black"   (**Background**)

I have imported the fonts from Google: "**Abril+Fatface**" (For the main Nirvana logo located at the top left). "**Gloria+Hallelujah**" (For the main text spread across the whole site).
I chose "Abril+Fatface" as it resembles the actual font used for the real Nirvana logo. I chose the "Gloria+Hallelujah" font as I thought it fits well with the "rock/grunge" band genre.
